/**
 * \brief Solves the inverse kinematics problem.
 *
 * Important note: If the model contains constraints, then the tracking is very
 * slow. Constraint tracking could be controlled by changing the
 * constraintsWeight. If the constraintsWeight is set to SimTK::Infinity, then
 * the constraints are tracked perfectly. If it is set to zero, then the problem
 * is relaxed thus can be solved faster. Note that, there are models that use
 * coordinate coupled constraints which eventually are not important for the
 * tracking as day depend on some coordinate (e.g., patella as a function of
 * knee angle). In this case, they could be ignored without affecting the
 * overall solution and speed up the process.
 *
 * TODO:
 *
 * 1) Support for IKCoordinateTask
