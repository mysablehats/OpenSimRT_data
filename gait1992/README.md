# Processing of Data

This folder contains the results obtained from OpenSim analyses. This folder can
be used as a template for other subjects, provided that they use the same marker
set (located scale folder). For the subject scaling, make sure to specify the
subject mass in the `scale/setup_scale.xml`. The `.py` scripts must be updated
accordingly (e.g., subject height).
